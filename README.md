## [Project 1 : Stock Market Prediction & Portfolio Optimization : Project Overview](https://github.com/shalininayak/academic_projects/blob/main/Stock%20Market%20Prediction%20%26%20Portfolio%20Optimization.ipynb)
* This project has been made as an attempt to do stock market predictions using Machine Learning algorithms, aiming to know a stock future value for an investor's profit.
* The dataset has been obtained from the NSE (National Stock Exchange)and Bloomberg websites, which contains different stocks, including small, medium, and large-cap companies. The stocks are subjected to training with time series Machine Learning models, and their performance are compared. 
* The ML models used for this project are Random Forest, XG Boost, Auto-Arima and LSTM. The model with the best accuracy will be finally used for stock predictions to visualize performance for two days, one week, two weeks, and one month while creating a portfolio for investors. LSTM appears to be the model with the highest accuracy and better performance in this project.
* Portfolio optimization is done to give weights to stocks to aid investors in decision making.
