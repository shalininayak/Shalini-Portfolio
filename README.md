## [Stock Market Prediction & Analysis + Portfolio Optimization : Project Overview](https://github.com/shalininayak/academic_projects/blob/main/Stock%20Market%20Prediction%20%26%20Portfolio%20Optimization.ipynb)
* This project has been made as an attempt to do stock market predictions using Machine Learning algorithms, aiming to know a stock future value for an investor's profit. The project contains detailed business and data analysis: Data Extraction->Data Cleaning->Exponential Data Analysis->Modelling->Prediction->Business & Financial Analysis.
* The dataset has been obtained from the NSE (National Stock Exchange)and Bloomberg websites, which contains different stocks, including small, medium, and large-cap companies. The stocks are subjected to training with time series Machine Learning models, and their performance are compared. 
* The ML models used for this project are Random Forest, XG Boost, Auto-Arima and LSTM. The model with the best accuracy will be finally used for stock predictions to visualize performance for two days, one week, two weeks, and one month while creating a portfolio for investors. LSTM appears to be the model with the highest accuracy and better performance in this project.
* Portfolio optimization is done to give weights to stocks to aid investors in decision making.

## [Stock Market Prediction & Analysis + Portfolio Optimization : Project Overview]
(https://github.com/shalininayak/Shalini-Portfolio/blob/main/Exponential%20Business%20Analytics.pdf)
* This study ( containing Data Analysis + Hypothesis Testing + Descriptive statistics) is based on a research paper “DOES WORKING FROM HOME WORK? EVIDENCE FROM A CHINESE EXPERIMENT*” where the results of a Work From Home experiment at Ctrip were reported. Ctrip is a NASDAQ-listed Chinese Travel Agency with a strength of 16000 employees.
* The experiment concluded many amazing results, there was a drastic improvement and increase in satisfaction, and productivity and 13% increase in performance, and work hours and a 50% reduction in the attrition level of employees in the treatment group and then the controlled group. Also, employees took lesser also breaks and sick leaves, all because of the convenience of being at home. However, there was one demerit of what this experiment concluded that is promotions dropped by 50% associated with performance. 
* Elaborating more on satisfaction, the employees WFH has a more positive attitude and a greater level of satisfaction. The data collected from the Chinese experiment are several like performance, attrition, promotions, satisfaction etc. This report shall focus on data analysis and descriptive statistics of satisfaction.
